# File Extension Manager

This project is a command-line tool built in Python to automate file management tasks.  
It was developed as part of coursework to demonstrate file handling, version control, and testing.

## Features
- Scan Directory: Lists all files in the current folder
- Categorize Files: Groups files by extension (e.g., Images, Documents, Executables)
- Rename Files: Renames files systematically (e.g., file_1.txt, file_2.png)
- Revert Files: Restores original filenames using saved history
- CLI Menu: Simple interface for selecting operations

## Structure
- main.py: Contains all functions and CLI logic
- README.md: Project overview and usage instructions

## Testing
Each function was tested individually.  
Screenshots and results are included in the report.

## Version Control
Git was used for version control.  
Each function was committed separately to ensure clear history and traceability.
